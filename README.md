This is a Data Structure &amp; Algorithm Project focusing on MST, Branch and Bound Algorithm, and TSP Heuristics.

1. Calculate a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) to find the subset of edges that represent the lowest edge weight cost to connect all vertices.

2. Research and implement the Cheapest Insertion algorithm to approximate a solution to the Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP)

3. Calculate the weight of an optimal TSP solution, using a branch and bound algorithm.
